% Important:
% Before using the toolbox compile the solution:
% Please note, you need a compiler on your platform already installed. The compiler is not part of this toolbox,
% If you use Windows machines this can be added by installing MS Visual Studio 2015 (free from Microsoft).
% If you use other platform you need to instal a valid c++ compiler x86 or x64 according to your architecture.
% Note that / and \ in the path change along with the platform (Linux, Windows, MAC), so please open the make file and check before running it.
% Then just run the make file below.
% make;
