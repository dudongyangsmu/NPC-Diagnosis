function [RANKED, WEIGHT] = reliefF( X, Y, K )
%   [RANKED,WEIGHT] = relieff(X,Y,K) computes ranks and weights of
%     attributes (predictors) for input data matrix X and response vector Y
%     using ReliefF algorithm for classification or RReliefF for regression
%     with K nearest neighbors. For classification, relieff uses K nearest
%     neighbors per class. RANKED are indices of columns in X ordered by
%     attribute importance, meaning RANKED(1) is the index of the most
%     important predictor. WEIGHT are attribute weights ranging from -1 to 1
%     with large positive weights assigned to important attributes.
%  
%     If Y is numeric, relieff by default performs RReliefF analysis for
%     regression. If Y is categorical, logical, a character array, or a cell
%     array of strings, relieff by default performs ReliefF analysis for
%     classification.
%  
%     Attribute ranks and weights computed by relieff usually depend on K. If
%     you set K to 1, the estimates computed by relieff can be unreliable for
%     noisy data. If you set K to a value comparable with the number of
%     observations (rows) in X, relieff can fail to find important
%     attributes. 
%     You can start with K=10 and investigate the stability and
%     reliability of relieff ranks and weights for various values of K.
